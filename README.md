# Fake History Browser

This project is a fake browser history generator that mimics a modern browser (Edge-like) interface. It allows you to add, view, and manage fake history entries, then switch to full screen mode for taking realistic screenshots.

## Features
- Realistic browser UI with tabs, address bar, and window controls.
- Add/edit fake history entries with title, URL, time, and date.
- History is grouped by date with a custom dark-themed scrollbar.
- Full screen mode with on-screen instructions for capturing screenshots.
- Uses Font Awesome icons for a professional look.

## Files
- **index.html**: Main HTML file for the Fake History Browser.
- **styles.css**: Custom CSS for styling the browser UI.
- **script.js**: JavaScript for handling history operations and full screen mode.
- **README.md**: This file.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser (use a local server if necessary).
3. Use the control panel to add history items.
4. Click "Full Screen Mode" and use your systemâ€™s screenshot tool (e.g., Print Screen) to capture the browser window.
